# GemGridQuest

## Overview

The game simulates an environment where players navigate through a grid to collect jewels—such as diamonds, rubies, opals—while avoiding guardians. Each jewel has a value assessed in gold coins, and the guardians have life points. The game's objective is to accumulate wealth by collecting jewels and outmaneuvering the guardians on the board.

## Features

- Incorporates classes for different types of contents with properties such as jewel value and guardian life points.
- Enables player movement with and without force across the grid while collecting treasures and interacting with guardians.
- Includes a simulation class that sets up the game environment and runs the game for a specified number of steps, with randomness introduced in player movements and interactions.
- A test class demonstrates the game functionality and generates a log of the actions taken and their outcomes.
